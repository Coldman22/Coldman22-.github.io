									<h3> Inspirations</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/A.jpg" alt="" /></span>Arthur Samuel (1901-1990) was a pioneer of artificial intelligence research. From 1949 through the late 1960s, he did the best work in making computers learn from their experience. His vehicle for this was the game of checkers. Programs for playing games often fill the role in artificial intelligence research that the fruit fly Drosophila plays in genetics. Drosophilae are convenient for genetics because they breed fast and are cheap to keep, and games are convenient for artificial intelligence because it is easy to compare computer performance with that of people.Samuel took advantage of another fact about checkers for his learning research. Namely, the checker players have many volumes of annotated games with the good moves distinguished from the bad ones. Samuel's learning program used Lee's Guide to Checkers to adjust its criteria for choosing moves so that the program would choose those thought good by checker experts as often as possible.</p>

He is the founder, CEO, and Chief Engineer at SpaceX; early-stage investor, CEO, and Product Architect of Tesla, Inc.; founder of The Boring Company; and co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI.The tech billionaire, who profited from an early investment in DeepMind, told The New York Times that his experience of working with AI at Tesla means he is able to say with confidence “that we’re headed toward a situation where AI is vastly smarter than humans.” He said he believes the time frame is less than five years. “That doesn’t mean everything goes to hell in five years. It just means that things get unstable or weird,” he said. </p>

									<div class="About ">
										<span class="image left"><img src="images/i.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										<p>I completed my Bachelor's in Engineering in the year 2021. And did my bachelor's in Civil Engineering from SPPU (Savitribai Phule Pune University).I was fascinated by the working of systems and the transfer of Information.<br/>
										More over something, I was wondering in the deep oceans of youtube and I stumbled upon a diamond, which was "THE LIBRARY OF BABEL".<br/>
									    And my curosity about the IT and computer science spiked up. and from then I started pondering and studying about dataframes, datastructures, machine-learning, deep-learning, AI, and neural network.<br/>
									    Initally I preffered to study Data Analysis but later I realized the true depth and power of Data science and from then I started to learn, study and observe data science with keen interest.</p>
